# Waste Sorting App â€“ Machine Learning Model  

This repository contains the machine learning model for waste classification, built using **TensorFlow and VGG (transfer learning)**.  

## Overview  
The model is trained to classify waste images into categories based on visual features. It can be integrated with the backend to provide classification results.  

## Dataset  
The model is trained on the **TrashNet** dataset, which contains labeled images of various waste types.
